# Solar System and Galaxies Programs
=====================================

## About the Programs
This repository contains a collection of Python programs that use the `turtle` module to simulate the movement of celestial bodies in our Solar System and other galaxies. The programs are designed to be educational and fun, and can be used to learn about the basics of astronomy and programming.

## Programs Included
### Solar System Programs

* **earth_moon.py**: A program that simulates the rotation of the Earth and the orbit of the Moon.
* **solar_system.py**: A program that simulates the movement of the planets in our Solar System.

### Galaxy Programs

* **andromeda.py**: A program that simulates the Andromeda galaxy, including stars, planets, and a black hole.

## How to Run the Programs
To run the programs, simply download the repository and run the Python files using Python 3.x. For example, to run the **andromeda.py** program, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the repository and type `python andromeda.py` in your terminal or command prompt.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* `turtle` module (comes pre-installed with Python)
